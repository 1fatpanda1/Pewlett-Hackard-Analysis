- There are 1,549 eligible mentors. A large majority of these eligible mentors are either engineers or staff of some sort while the remaining 77 are Technique leaders.
- None of the eligible mentors are managers.

## Summary

There are 72,458 employees across 6 roles that will likely need replacements as the "silver tsunami" begins to make impact. The company will need to actively recruit/train new employees as roughly 30% of their current workforce will be retiring. While there are 1,549 eligible mentors, if the company wants to hold a relatively stable number of employees, there probably are not enough mentor eligible employees. Aside from having 0 eligible managers that could train other managers, the ratio of recruits needed to eligible mentors is quite large. This would likely lead to improperly trained employees causing further turmoil at Pewlett Hackard.
